# Task 6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm 
This repository provides an overview of prediction using the decision tree algorithm. The decision tree algorithm is a widely used machine learning technique that enables predictive modeling in various domains.

## Overview

The decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning method that builds a predictive model in the form of a tree-like structure. It is a non-parametric algorithm, meaning it does not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. Instead, it focuses on constructing a tree by recursively partitioning the data based on the values of input features.

The decision tree algorithm starts with a root node and splits the data based on a selected feature, creating child nodes. This splitting process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth, achieving a minimum number of samples per leaf, or no further improvement in predictive performance.

Each internal node of the decision tree represents a decision based on a specific feature. The decision is made by evaluating a splitting criterion, such as Gini impurity or information gain, to determine the feature's predictive power. The child nodes represent the possible outcomes or branches resulting from the decision.

The leaves of the decision tree represent the final predictions or outcomes. When a new instance is fed into the decision tree, it traverses down the tree, following the decision paths based on the feature values, until it reaches a leaf node. The prediction associated with that leaf node is then assigned to the new instance.

## Advantages

The decision tree algorithm offers several advantages:

1. **Interpretability**: Decision trees provide intuitive and interpretable models. The splitting criteria and decision paths can be easily understood and visualized, allowing stakeholders to gain insights into the decision-making process.

2. **Handling Non-linear Relationships**: Decision trees can capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable. By recursively partitioning the data, decision trees can create complex decision boundaries and capture intricate patterns.

3. **Feature Importance**: Decision trees can assess the importance of each feature in the predictive task. By examining the feature's position in the tree and the associated splitting criterion, we can gain insights into the relative importance of different features.

4. **Handling Missing Values**: Decision trees can handle missing values in the data by creating surrogate splits or treating missing values as a separate category during the splitting process. This flexibility is beneficial when dealing with datasets with incomplete or partially missing information.

5. **Robustness**: Decision trees are robust to outliers and noise in the data. Since each decision is made based on a subset of features, outliers have less impact on the overall model performance.

## Limitations

While decision trees have many advantages, they also have certain limitations:

1. **Overfitting**: Decision trees tend to overfit the training data, especially when the tree becomes too complex. Overfitting occurs when the tree learns to capture noise and irrelevant patterns in the training data, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.

2. **Instability**: Decision trees are sensitive to small changes in the training data. A slight variation in the data may result in a different decision tree structure, which can impact the model's predictions.

3. **Bias towards Features with Many Levels**: Decision trees may exhibit a bias towards features with a large number of levels or categories. Features with many levels tend to have a higher chance of being selected for splitting, potentially overshadowing other features.

4. **Lack of Global Optimization**: Decision trees make local decisions based on the available data at each node. They do not optimize the global objective directly, which can lead to suboptimal models compared to algorithms that optimize the entire model simultaneously.
